## Example Usage - Gkehub Membership Basic


```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name               = "basiccluster"
  location           = "us-central1-a"
  initial_node_count = 1
  provider = google-beta
}

resource "google_gke_hub_membership" "membership" {
  membership_id = "basic"
  external_id = "aaaaaaaaa"
  endpoint {
    gke_cluster {
      resource_link = "//container.googleapis.com/${google_container_cluster.primary.id}"
    }
  }
  description = "test resource."
  provider = google-beta
}
```

The following arguments are supported:


* `membership_id` -
  (Required)
  The client-provided identifier of the membership.

* `description` -
  (Required)
  The name of this entity type to be displayed on the console.

* `external_id` -
  (Required)
  An externally-generated and managed ID for this Membership.
  This ID may still be modified after creation but it is not recommended to do so.
  The ID must match the regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]*` If this Membership
  represents a Kubernetes cluster, this value should be set to the UUID of the
  kube-system namespace object.


- - -


* `labels` -
  (Optional)
  Labels to apply to this membership.

* `endpoint` -
  (Optional)
  If this Membership is a Kubernetes API server hosted on GKE, this is a self link to its GCP resource.
  Structure is documented below.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


The `endpoint` block supports:

* `gke_cluster` -

The `gke_cluster` block supports:

* `resource_link` -
  (Optional)
  Self-link of the GCP resource for the GKE cluster.
  For example: `//container.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/zones/us-west1-a/clusters/my-cluster`.
  It can be at the most 1000 characters in length.  If the cluster is provisioned with Terraform,
  this is `"//container.googleapis.com/${google_container_cluster.my-cluster.id}"`.

## Attributes Reference
